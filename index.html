      <p>Each song tells a story that <i>ends</i> as follows:</p>
      <ul>            
         <li><h2>Sisyphus's Escape</h2>Sisyphus Escaped.</li>
         <li><h2>Epicycles</h2>Ends as it began; you made convoluted excuses so you didn't learn anything.</li>
         <li><h2>Yesterday's Supercomputer</h2>Culminates in a young spider busily wrapping up then decapitating an older spider.</li>
         <li><h2>Fractional Personality Disorder</h2>Eends in getting way too drunk as the sober version of yourself wasn't working either.</li>
         <li><h2>Take Me To Hell</h2>Ends in a requiem for a resistance fighter.</li>
         <li><h2>Mercuriella</h2>Fails to keep up with someone's mercurial moods.</li>
         <li><h2>You're Very Special</h2>Ends in a question. Are you?</li>
         <li><h2>Fertilized Egg</h2>Ends in pregnancy.</li>
         <li><h2>Unsympathetic Vibrations</h2>Ends in an argument between a couple of small but aggressive animals.</li>
         <li><h2>Sleeping On A Ledge</h2>Ends with a sunrise on top of a mountain.</li>
         <li><h2>Meditalien</h2>Lands back on earth after locking eyes with a meditating alien.</li>
         <li><h2>Reaching For The Stairs</h2>Ends with someone you love finally losing their battle with an incurable disease.</li>
         <li><h2>Hiding In A Dream</h2>Ends waking up from a bad dream where you were not yourself.</li>
         <li><h2>Spaghettification</h2>Ends with your life flashing before your eyes as you fall into the event horizon of a black hole.</li>
      </ul>

         Music without lyrics or accompanying visuals is just a river of feelings, so imagine your own stories, imagery and associations.
